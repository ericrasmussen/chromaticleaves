### Obsession with tea

Initially I began drinking tea as a replacement for soda and other sugary
drinks, at a time when I had only tried the most mundane teas and didn't really
know what it was all about. My wife set me on the path to discovering quality
teas, and since then we have visited tea shops all over California, in New York,
and in Paris. I am more tea fanatic than expert, but I have tried many
lesser known teas and want to spread enthusiasm and interest in tea drinking.


### Tea vendors

This is a very short list of tea vendors (in no particular order) that I highly
recommend. I always keep tea from each of them stocked:

* [Numi Tea](http://numitea.com/)
* [Harney & Sons](http://www.harney.com/)
* [Tea List](http://tea-list.com/)
* [Mountain View Tea Village](http://www.mvteavillage.com/)
* [Samovar](http://www.samovarlife.com/)
* [Mariage Fr√®res](http://www.mariagefreres.com/)
