### Overview

I am an avid music listener, amateur performing classical guitarist, and former
music critic (for the now defunct StarVox online zine). I primarily used to
write about various forms of metal, but recently I am inclined to write about
various forms of classical.


### 7-String Guitar Transcriptions

Most of my transcriptions were made with Lilypond and are missing some of my
handwritten notes. I am including only the rendered PDFs below, but if you are
truly interested in seeing the original Lilypond scores or want additional
performance notes, please contact me.

### Concert bio

Eric Rasmussen began studying classical guitar with Matthew Grasso in 2003 and
began playing the 7-string classical guitar in 2005. He has performed a variety
of solo and ensemble classical guitar works throughout Northern California,
including performances with Trio Seven and the Indian Classical Fusion
group, the Nada Brahma Music Ensemble. Eric has been active in the Sacramento
Guitar Society and played in a master class with Jim Kline. Eric has performed
in concert with the American River College Orchestra, Solano Youth Symphony, and
Vox Musica. His guitar arrangements include Franck's Choral (for 7-string duo),
Satie's Gymnopedie No. 1, Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata (first movement), and the
Aria from Bach's Goldberg Variations. Eric has also performed on radio, TV, and
appears on recordings with Nada Brahma and Matthew Grasso.
