metadescription: Brief overview of one of the most popular oolong teas in America by Eric Rasmussen of Chromatic Leaves.

Ti Kuan Yin, or Iron Goddess, is undoubtedly one of the most popular oolong teas
in America. Oolong teas have partially oxidized leaves, placing them somewhere
between green tea (non-oxidized leaves) and black tea (fully oxidized
leaves). But don't let that simple description fool you -- oolong teas have
mysterious properties all their own.

In general, oolong teas can be steeped several times, and instead of losing
flavor or strength, each additional steeping unveils new layers of
complexity. To properly enjoy oolong teas, I will typically brew the leaves in
1-2 minute intervals, which is more than sufficient for many loose leaf oolong
teas. Depending on the variety of tea, you may continue to find hidden layers of
depth for several steepings.

Ti Kuan Yin yields a dark, roasted flavor that has the vegetal quality you'd
expect to find in a green tea, but the robust body of a black tea. This makes
the tea a solid coffee alternative for breakfast, but I've found it works just
as well with an afternoon meal. It's strong enough to hold its own with food,
but light enough not to overpower it. Oolong teas aren't as widely available as
green or black teas, so if you aren't sure where to start looking, there are
large selections (with helpful descriptions) available at both Mountain View Tea
Village and Harney & Sons.
