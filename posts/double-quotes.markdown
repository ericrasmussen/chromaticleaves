metadescription: An unaccomplished writer explores the acceptance of punctuation for expressing irony.
---

I am beginning to believe there was an undocumented but watershed turning point
in the history of American marketing. A point in which all of the advertising
and marketing overlords convened and launched a secret war on punctuation.

I imagine the overlords, seated in too-high chairs around a too-round table,
engaged in a discussion similar to this one:

> "Our copy writers keep bogging down slogans with funny symbols!"
>
> "Or they take out the symbols I use randomly for emphasis!"
>
> "We must gain control of these symbols at once. We need to take the power out
> of the writ'er's' hand's'. But how?"
>
> "Ladies and gentlemen, our course is clear: if we begin confusing the next
> generation of customers now, one day no one will even know how to use an
> apostrophe."

And so it went. Now we have *book's* on sale, you can *relax your at* a hair
salon, you can eat *spaghetti?*, and you can even brave *extreme!!* foods.

For the most part it's easy to follow the intent of these misguided ads and
product names, although *relax your a--*<sup>*</sup> required a double take.

When it comes to apostrophes, I think it's clear the marketing overlords of
generations past have won. You may now freely sprinkle or omit apostrophes as
you see fit as long as you think it highlights or emphasizes your message in
some way. I've even seen *strawberrie's* for sale. Go on, give it a try. Why
not. No one will even notice.

But I am pleased to say that there is one front on which they are losing ground:
double quotes.

Perhaps in part thanks to this guy:

I am fairly certain the large marketing firms have caught on by now, but
our culture associates unnecessary double quotes with irony. For once, I'm not
the first person to question the local real estate "expert" or the "fresh"
chicken on sale.

Nevertheless, I fear the efforts to abuse punctuation will continue. Do not let
this small victory sway you, fellow pedants. Stay vigilant!
