Death's final studio album is one of the all time metal classics. On The Sound
of Perseverance, Death took their brand of technical progressive thrash death
metal to the next level. This is death metal evolved.

Most tracks open with sparse instrumentation. Deep bass lines, drum solos, lead
guitar melodies, welcoming you to a new soundscape before the rest of the band
appears. Before the thick guitar and bass riffs take over, the drums pound
relentlessly, the scratchy vocals and lyrics invade your consciousness. Soon
all of the instruments are building and pushing and driving to create an
oppressive atmosphere, making it harder to breathe, harder to think, a deadly
wall of sound compelling and propelling you deeper into their vision.

Just when you can't take any more, it stops. A heroic melody swoops in to the
rescue, letting you soar through the world they've created. Soon you're
surrounded by glitchy high-speed guitar solos, unexpected drum fills played with
impossible accuracy, bass and rhythm guitars carrying you further and further
inward until there's nothing left but you and the music.  But you have only a
moment to reflect before another chaotic shift in tempo leaves you stranded in
the fray, the frenzy of chugging riffs and blast beat drums.

Usually when we talk about progressive metal we mean metal with classically
influenced melodies and harmonies, sweep picking and scales, and the many other
ways skilled musicians have learned to show off their skills. You won't get that
here. You'll get the sound of a band that evolved naturally, forever in debt to
the heavy metal and thrash that preceded it, but carving ahead well into
uncharted territory.

Death's magic is making you a part of their journey. It's tragic that they never
got the attention they deserved<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>, and far more so that
lead guitarist/songwriter Chuck Schuldiner passed away at 34. If you missed out
on The Sound of Perseverance for any reason before, now's the time to get
it. This metal is just as relevant today as it was in 2008.
