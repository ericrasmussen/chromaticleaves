Saint-Saëns (1835-1921) is perhaps best known for his many beautiful works
featuring solo violin, such as the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso or The
Swan. In certain circles, you may even hear about his lesser known Messe de
Requiem, a tragic and deeply-felt choral work. What you don’t often hear about
are his two piano trios, both formidable pieces, fully realized by Trio Wanderer
in this excellent recording.

The first of the trios, in F major, was composed in 1864 and is full of vibrant
energy, gracefully moving lines, and delicate passages. The second trio, in E
minor, premièred in 1892, evoking a mood of melancholy punctuated by moments of
dark intensity. The clarity of both works is astounding in terms of
orchestration, performance, and recording quality.

Trio Wanderer plays beautifully, letting each of the lines come through without
any one player dominating the sound. There are many fast passages throughout the
works that require the musicians to all play energetically, but even at peak
intensity you never lose track of any instrument. This is a highly recommended
work for anyone who enjoys chamber music.
